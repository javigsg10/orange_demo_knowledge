The insurance price is determined by the characteristics of your home, such as the square footage, year of construction, location, the coverages you select, and whether you insure only the contents or also the building itself, and the amount of the insured capital...

In your Home Insurance, the building includes all the constructive and structural elements that make up a building or home, such as walls, ceilings, floors, or installations like heating, water, or electricity, among others, which you can consult in your policy terms.

When we talk about contents in home insurance, we refer to everything inside your house, from furniture and appliances to clothing. Some items require a special declaration, such as jewelry, artworks, or valuable items, as their unit value exceeds a certain amount. To better understand what contents mean, think of everything that would fall if you turned the house upside down: your furniture, your clothes, your books... if the unit value of any of your items exceeds 3,000 euros, you should consider it as jewelry or a special valuable item.

Our Home Insurance adapts to the level of protection you need with three options: Lite, Complete, and Total. You can find all the product documentation in our home insurance brochure.

With our home insurance, you will be covered against the most common unforeseen events, such as fires, glass breakage, and water damage. Additionally, you can customize it with what your home needs: key replacement, ceramic cooktop breakage, storage room theft, garden and terrace furniture... You can check the extent of these coverages in the general conditions of the home insurance policy. Depending on the conditions contracted, your Zurich home insurance will protect you at home and away, covering you and all family members living in the insured property, including pets. For example, if your dog bites a third party and is not classified as a dangerous dog, the civil liability coverage will take care of it (up to the limits of the general conditions).

How Much Should I Insure My Furniture, Appliances, and Other Belongings For?
You need to calculate the value of your items, which we call "contents."

To better understand what contents mean, think of everything that would fall if you turned the house upside down: your furniture, your clothes, your books... If the unit value of any of your items exceeds 3,000 euros, you should consider it as jewelry or a special valuable item. Additionally, it is mandatory to have a basic home insurance policy with fire coverage to protect the bank's investment. However, it is not mandatory to purchase your home insurance from the financial institution.
